# 🧠 Image Captioning AI  
Python Streamlit License

An interactive AI-based image captioning system built with Python and Streamlit.  
This project automatically generates captions for input images using a CNN-LSTM architecture. It uses ResNet50 for feature extraction and LSTM for sequence generation, all wrapped in a user-friendly web UI.
