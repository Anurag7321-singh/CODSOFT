# ðŸ§  Tic-Tac-Toe AI â€“ Unbeatable AI Opponent with Minimax + Multiplayer Mode

## ðŸ“– Description
This project implements a **Tic-Tac-Toe game** in Python with two modes:
1. **Human vs AI** â€“ Powered by the Minimax algorithm (with Alpha-Beta pruning), making the AI unbeatable.
2. **Multiplayer Mode** â€“ Play against another human locally.

It also offers both **CLI (terminal-based)** and **Streamlit (GUI)** versions for an interactive experience.
